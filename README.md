# filthy_filter

I made this chrome extension during finals week. I was watching some youtube videos and there was a ton of profanity. 

Anyway, I wanted to make some sort of filter, or something. 

So I worked with the browser API to mute the tab when it read a swear in the auto generated subtitles. 

It broke eventually because it used brittle scraping on the youtube page. 

It was pretty awesome, as part of it though I had to have a HUGE list of profanity, so that was fun. 

Feel free to use it, but it probably doesn't work anymore.
